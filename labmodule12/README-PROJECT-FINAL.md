Why do you care about this particular problem? Write 1 to 2 paragraphs in response.



## How - Expected Technical Approach

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs describing the outcomes you achieved.


### System Diagram

Embed a block diagram depicting your overall design, including the CDA, GDA, and Cloud Services interactions.
Be sure to include arrows depicting data flow from one application / service to the next.



Write 1 to 2 paragraphs describing your design.



### What THREE (3) sensors and ONE (1) actuator did you use (add more if you wish)?

- CDA Sensor 1: 

- CDA Sensor 2: 

- CDA Sensor 3: 

- CDA Actuator 1: 



### What ONE (1) CDA protocol and TWO (2) GDA protocols did you implement (add more if you wish)?

- CDA to GDA Protocol: 

- GDA to CDA Protocol: 

- GDA to Cloud Protocol: 

- Cloud to GDA Protocol: 


 
### What TWO (2) cloud services / capabilities did you use (add more if you wish)?

- Cloud Service 1 (data ingress - all inputs):

- Cloud Service 2 (data egress - all actuation events):



## Screen Shots Representing Cloud Services



### Screen Shots Representing Visualized Data

NOTE: Include (at least) TWO (2) screen shots - one showing at least 1 hour
of time-series data from the CDA, and one showing an event being triggered
that results in an actuation event sent to your GDA and then to your CDA.
