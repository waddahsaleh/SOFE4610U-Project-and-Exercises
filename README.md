# Programming the IoT - Book Exercise Docs

If you're a student of Connected Devices, clone this repository so you can capture the documentation artifacts
for each Lab Module exercise you'll implement as part of this course.

If you're reading [Programming the Internet of Things](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/), whether as a student of my IoT course or for fun, you can also use this repository to help track your progress with the exercises using the simple Markdown checklists provided in each sub-directory.

# What You'll Find In This Project

Each sub-directory maps to a specific Lab Module, which also aligns to the exercises listed in [Programming the Internet of Things](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).
Within each sub-directory are the Markdown files that correlate to the documentation you can fill out related to each Chapter's exercise, as follows:
  - CDA-REQ-CHECKLIST.md: Use this to check off the CDA-specific (Constrained Device App) exercise tasks for the named Lab Module. This file will only exist if there are CDA-specific tasks to complete.
  - GDA-REQ-CHECKLIST.md: Use this to check off the GDA-specific (Gateway Device App) exercise tasks for the named Lab Module. This file will only exist if there are GDA-specific tasks to complete.
  - CSF-REQ-CHECKLIST.md: Use this to check off the CSF-specific (Cloud Service Functions) exercise tasks for the named Lab Module. This file will only exist if there are CSF-specific tasks to complete.
  - README-CDA.md: Use this to document your CDA-specific design. This file will only exist if there is CDA-specific documentation to complete.
  - README-GDA.md: Use this to document your GDA-specific design. This file will only exist if there is GDA-specific documentation to complete.
  - README-CSF.md: Use this to document your CSF-specific design. This file will only exist if there is CSF-specific documentation to complete.
  - README-PROJECT-PROPOSAL.md: Use this to document your Semester Project Proposal. This file only exists as part of Lab Module 12.
  - README-PROJECT-FINAL.md: Use this to document your Semester Project Final Write-up. This file only exists as part of Lab Module 12.

If you're reading this Markdown page, you may be asking yourself, "do I need to complete this documentation?". If...
  - You're in my Connected Devices class, yes - these are required as part of each Lab Module submission.
  - You're reading [Programming the Internet of Things](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/), it's completely up to you.
  - Neither of the above apply to you, it's completely up to you.
